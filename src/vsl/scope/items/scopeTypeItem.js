     *     cast to. We'll assume that you've done all the checks because if
     *     something is wrong here expect big giant segfaults. If you have a

     * @param {?(ScopeTypeItem[])} data.genericParents - A series of parents
     *     which match the generic templates.

     *     of the current class, don't specify if there is none. You don't need
     *     to resolve inheritance or anything.
     * @param {boolean} data.isInterface - Whether the type is an interface.
     *     This is used to determine how casting will occur and dynamic dispatch
     *     so ensure that it is not possible to declare fields.
